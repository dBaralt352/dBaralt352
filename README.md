### Hallo!
---
Im Daniel Baralt!
Developing since 2022, and creating bugs even before that!

This is where I'll be uploading all my bugs, i mean features and hopefully make a good app.

Im currently working on some CLI apps for myself to manage with more ease my computer, and if it works for me, why it wouldn't be useful for others?
And maybe some ideas will be here as well.
